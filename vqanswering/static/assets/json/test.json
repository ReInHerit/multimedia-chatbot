      "value": "Edgar Degas was a French Impressionist artist known for his pastel drawings and oil paintings. He was born as Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas on 19 July 1834 and died on 27 September 191
7. Although he is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, he rejected the term and preferred to be called a realist. He is especially identified with the subject of dance, with more than half of his works depicting dancers. Degas was also a superb draftsman, particularly masterly in depicting movement, as seen in his renditions of dancers and bathing female nudes."

s are notable for their psychological complexity and their portrayal of human isolation. In addition to ballet dancers and bathing women, Degas painted racehorses and racing jockeys, as well as portr
aits. At the beginning of his career, Degas wanted to be a history painter, and he brought the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter, becoming a classical painter of modern life."

      "from": "gpt",
      "value": "Degas was born in Paris, France, into a moderately wealthy family. He was the oldest of five children of C\u00e9lestine Musson De Gas, a Creole from New Orleans, Louisiana, and August
in De Gas, a banker. His maternal grandfather Germain Musson, was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, of French descent, and had settled in New Orleans in 1810. Degas began his schooling at age eleven, en
rolling in the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand. His mother died when he was thirteen, and the main influences on him for the remainder of his youth were his father and several unmarried uncles. Degas began to paint early in life and by the time he graduated from the Lyc\u00e9e with a baccalaur\u00e9at in literature in 1853, at age 18, he had turned a room in his home into an artist's studio."

      "value": "Upon his return to France in 1859, Degas moved into a Paris studio large enough to permit him to begin painting The Bellelli Family\u2014an imposing canvas he intended for exhibition
in the Salon, although it remained unfinished until 1867. He also began work on several history paintings. In 1861, Degas visited his childhood friend Paul Valpin\u00e7on in Normandy, and made the ea
rliest of his many studies of horses. He exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1865. Although he exhibited annually in the Salon during the next five years, he submitted no more history painti
ngs. The change in his art was influenced primarily by the example of \u00c9douard Manet, whom Degas had met in 1864. Upon the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Degas enlisted in the Natio
nal Guard, where his defense of Paris left him little time for painting. After the war, Degas began in 1872 an extended stay in New Orleans, where his brother Ren\u00e9 and a number of other relative
s lived. Degas returned to Paris in 1873 and his father died the following year, whereupon Degas learned that his brother Ren\u00e9 had amassed enormous business debts. To preserve his family's reput
ation, Degas sold his house and an art collection he had inherited, and used the money to pay off his brother's debts. Dependent for the first time in his life on sales of his artwork for income, he
produced much of his greatest work during the decade beginning in 1874. Disenchanted by now with the Salon, he instead joined a group of young artists who were organizing an independent exhibiting society. The group soon became known as the Impressionists."

    },
    {
      "from": "gpt",
      "value": "Degas's style reflects his deep respect for the old masters and his great admiration for Ingres and Delacroix. He was also a collector of Japanese prints, whose compositional principl
es influenced his work, as did the vigorous realism of popular illustrators such as Daumier and Gavarni. Although famous for horses and dancers, Degas began with conventional historical paintings suc
h as The Daughter of Jephthah and The Young Spartans, in which his gradual progress toward a less idealized treatment of the figure is already apparent. During his early career, Degas also painted po
rtraits of individuals and groups. In his early paintings, Degas already evidenced the mature style that he would later develop more fully by cropping subjects awkwardly and by choosing unusual viewp
oints. By the late 1860s, Degas had shifted from his initial forays into history painting to an original observation of contemporary life. As his subject matter changed, so, too, did Degas's techniqu
e. The dark palette that bore the influence of Dutch painting gave way to the use of vivid colors and bold brushstrokes. The changes to his palette, brushwork, and sense of composition all evidence the influence that both the Impressionist movement and modern photography, with its spontaneous images and off-kilter angles, had on his work."

      "value": "Degas's only showing of sculpture during his life took place in 1881 when he exhibited The Little Dancer of Fourteen Years. A nearly life-size wax figure with real hair and dressed in
 a cloth tutu, it provoked a strong reaction from critics, most of whom found its realism extraordinary but denounced the dancer as ugly. After Degas's death, his heirs found in his studio 150 wax sc
ulptures, many in disrepair. They consulted foundry owner Adrien H\u00e9brard, who concluded that 74 of the waxes could be cast in bronze. It is assumed that, except for the Little Dancer Aged Fourteen, all Degas bronzes worldwide are cast from surmoulages (i.e., cast from bronze masters)."

      "from": "gpt",
      "value": "In 1877, Degas invited Mary Cassatt to exhibit in the third Impressionist exhibition. He had admired a portrait (Ida) she exhibited in the Salon of 1874, and the two formed a friendsh
ip. They had much in common: they shared similar tastes in art and literature, came from affluent backgrounds, had studied painting in Italy, and both were independent, never marrying. Both regarded
themselves as figure painters. After Cassatt's parents and sister Lydia joined Cassatt in Paris in 1877, Degas, Cassatt, and Lydia were often to be seen at the Louvre studying artworks together. Degas introduced Cassatt to pastel and engraving, while for her part Cassatt was instrumental in helping Degas sell his paintings and promoting his reputation in America."
