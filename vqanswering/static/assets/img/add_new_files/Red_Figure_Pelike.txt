A farewell scene of a warrior is depicted on the pelike (type of amphora), a quite popular subject of the 5th century BC. Adult men mostly dealt with the development of martial arts. They exercised and trained daily in order to be able to defend their home country in case of war. Women did not have the right to exercise and engage in sports activities and obviously they could not defend their home country and families. However, women had an important role within the household. As wives or mothers, women had a distinguished role in the family. Mothers or wives were the ones who offered libations, bidding farewell to their sons or husbands when they left the house to join the war.
