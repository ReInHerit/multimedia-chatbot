Two women pour water into their hydrias at a public waterspout, in an external space, as denoted by the hermaic stele. One young man addresses one of the women and as it seems, he sexually harasses her. The role of women was limited into the household sphere. One of the few opportunities they had to go out of the house was to carry water with their hydrias home. This scene depicts the way men treated women when they met them out of the house.
