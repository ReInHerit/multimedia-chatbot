Male figurines depict men in movement or with characteristics which denote a role. The figurines of hunters, warriors, musicians and others are representative examples of this. This is a male figurine which depicts a hunter or warrior. A baldric crosses the chest from the left shoulder (a baldric is the girdle which hangs over the shoulder and is used for the storage of weapons), while a triangular dagger is visible over his right hand. Which was his position in the society of the time? Objects such as weapons and tools could most probably be considered as status symbols denoting social standing and hierarchy. Without doubt, the role of certain men in the Early Cycladic society was distinguished and important.
