This rare loose-sheet map of Cyprus was issued in 1570, the year the Fourth Ottoman-Venetian War (1570-1573), also known as the “Guerra di Cipro”, had begun. The island’s shape is not based on any serious survey and unlike most maps of Cyprus, the map is not oriented towards the north, but the east. Cyprus is shown surrounded by an armada of warships, mostly Venetian with the exception of the top right corner showing Ottoman ships coming from Asia Minor, where the Ottomans are said to have set sail.

Due to its geo-political strategic position and rich agricultural production, Cyprus was reduced to a trading piece for larger empires ultimately greatly suffering the consequences of economic exploitation and violent conflict, the effects of which are still felt today.

For centuries, maps have been important tools in military logistics as well as critical means for understanding conflicts. The map depicts the island of Cyprus, whose shape is not based on any serious survey, and unlike most maps of Cyprus, it is not oriented towards the north, but the east. In an effort to depict the conflict, Nelli strategically places Ottoman warships coming from the East, and Venetian ships trying to defend their territory.

After years of tension with the Ottoman Empire resulting in frequent raids on the island,  during which Cypriots were taken captive and sold into slavery, the Ottomans invaded Cyprus with overwhelming force in 1570. The invasion resulted in much bloodshed and resulted in the islands occupation until 1878

Looking to expand their sphere of influence and control over the Eastern Mediterranean, the Venetian Republic annexed Cyprus in 1489. Cyprus strategic location near the Levant coast was of much interest to the Mediterranean world. The Venetians highly valued the island's location for trade and exploited the feudal system using the local serfs for costless labor.
