The postcard depicts a group of potters in the village of Phini in Cyprus making chatties, otherwise known as pottery jars or amphorae.
Having a unique and extensive tradition in pottery going back centuries, Phini has been one of the four most important centers of the craft in Cyprus. The craft has long been fruitful for the inhabitants of the village, with entire families being involved in the production of ceramic objects. Traditionally men made large earthenware storage vessels, whereas women manufactured vessels for keeping and transporting agricultural products and water. Today, this unique style of pottery is preserved by the women of Phini.
