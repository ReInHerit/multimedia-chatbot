The medallion on the interior of the kylix shows a naked youth drawing wine with an oinochoe from a krater. This is a symposium scene. Only men were allowed to attend symposia. We know the name of the young man from the inscription, his name was LYSIS. The word KALOS (handsome) refers to the impressive external appearance of the young man. Public expression of admiration and preference for people of the same sex were completely acceptable during ancient times. The inscription in the interior of the kylix is such an example. It was quite usual to depict erotic conversations between men in antiquity, although we do not know if the term diversity existed in ancient Greece.
