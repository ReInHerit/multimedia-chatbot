We cannot interpret the different roles of men and women with certainty, as no written texts or depictions of that time have survived. While female figurines are depicted with folded arms, in a passive position, male figurines depict men in movement or with characteristics which denote a role. The figurines of hunters, warriors, musicians are representative examples of this. 
Observing carefully the individual characteristics of the female figurines, the breasts, the pubic triangle, the slightly swollen abdomen, we understand the importance of the role of women which is associated with fertility and reproduction. 90% of the figurines are female and most of them have anatomical features related to fertility.
The idea behind Cycladic figurines is that they represent the great Mother Goddess. This reflects the idea that the society of that time might have been matriarchal.

This figurine could represent a woman in a state of pregnancy, or a deity connected with the fertility of nature.

The marble figurines are the masterpieces of Cycladic Art and some of the most preliminary representations of human form. The almost planar, marble forms characterized by simplicity and harmonious proportions, impressed and inspired artists such as Brancusi, Modigliani and others at the beginning of the 20th century. Through their works of art, these artists reintroduced the Cycladic figurines to the public and made them popular.
Marble was a material which was in abundance in the Cyclades area. The figurines which were constructed from 2800 to 2000 BC are all marble figurines. 
Marble figurines were decorated with colour in the face and body.
